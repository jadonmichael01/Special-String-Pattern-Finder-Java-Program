# Special-String-Pattern-Finder-Java-Program
A programming project for my programming course in FIU:
In this project, I implemented a java program that generates a random string of a given length and finds different
special patterns in the string.
The special patterns include: Singleton string, Arithemtic String Order 1, Arithmetic String Order 2, Balanced Tripartite,
Balanced Bipartite, and Palindrome.
Implemented user input with Scanner and System.in
Implemented the concept of exception handling
